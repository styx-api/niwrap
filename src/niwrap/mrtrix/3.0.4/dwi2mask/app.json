    "description": "Generates a whole brain mask from a DWI image.\n\nAll diffusion weighted and b=0 volumes are used to obtain a mask that includes both brain tissue and CSF.\n\nIn a second step peninsula-like extensions, where the peninsula itself is wider than the bridge connecting it to the mask, are removed. This may help removing artefacts and non-brain parts, e.g. eyes, from the mask.\n\nReferences:\n\nDhollander T, Raffelt D, Connelly A.
