    "description": "FastSurfer is a fast and accurate deep-learning-based neuroimaging pipeline that provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (via FastSurferVINN) and surface-based thickness analysis (via recon-surf). It can segment a whole brain MRI scan in under one minute on a GPU and produces FreeSurfer-compatible outputs, making it a drop-in replacement for FreeSurfer's recon-all pipeline. FastSurfer includes FastSurferVINN for whole brain segmentation, CerebNet for cerebellum sub-segmentation, and HypVINN for hypothalamus sub-segmentation.",
