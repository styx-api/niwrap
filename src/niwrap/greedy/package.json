    "description": "Greedy is a tool for fast deformable registration of 2D and 3D medical images. Developed at the Penn Image Computing and Science Lab (PICSL), it was designed for really fast CPU-based deformable image registration in applications where many images must be registered in parallel, such as multi-atlas segmentation. Greedy borrows concepts from Symmetric Normalization (SyN) in ANTs but uses a non-symmetric approach and highly optimized metric computation code for additional speed.",
