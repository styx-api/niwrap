    "description": "MRtrix3Tissue is a fork of MRtrix3 that adds capabilities for 3-Tissue Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) modelling and analysis. It provides Single-Shell 3-Tissue CSD (SS3T-CSD), enabling multi-tissue CSD analysis from single-shell diffusion MRI data without requiring multi-shell acquisitions.",
