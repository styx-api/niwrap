    "description": "This program is a user-level application for slice-by-slice translation registration. Results are regularized in z using polynomial regression. The program is targeted at spinal cord MRI. Only one stage is supported where a stage consists of a transform; an image metric; and iterations, shrink factors, and smoothing sigmas for each level. Specialized for 3D data: fixed image is 3D, moving image is 3D. Registration is performed slice-by-slice then regularized in z. The parameter -p controls the polynomial degree. -p 0 means no regularization."
