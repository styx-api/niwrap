    "description": "antsJointTensorFusion is an image fusion algorithm developed by Hongzhi Wang and Paul Yushkevich which won segmentation challenges at MICCAI 2012 and MICCAI 2013. The original label fusion framework was extended to accommodate intensities by Brian Avants. This implementation is based on the original ITK-style implementation and ANTsR implementation."
