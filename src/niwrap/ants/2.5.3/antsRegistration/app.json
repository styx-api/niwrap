    "description": "This program is a user-level registration application meant to utilize classes in ITK v4.0 and later. The user can specify any number of \"stages\" where a stage consists of a transform; an image metric; and iterations, shrink factors, and smoothing sigmas for each level. Note that explicitly setting the dimensionality, metric, transform, output, convergence, shrink-factors, and smoothing-sigmas parameters is mandatory."
