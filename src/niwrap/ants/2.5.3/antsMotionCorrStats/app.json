    "description": "Create summary measures of the parameters that are output by antsMotionCorr. Currently only works for linear transforms. Outputs the mean and max displacements for the voxels within a provided mask, at each time point. By default the displacements are relative to the reference space, but the framewise option may be used to provide displacements between consecutive time points."
