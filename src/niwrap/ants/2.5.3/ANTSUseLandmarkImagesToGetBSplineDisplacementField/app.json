    "description": "We expect the input images to be (1) N-ary (2) in the same physical space as the images you want to register and (3) to have the same landmark points defined within them. Landmarks will be defined from the center of mass of the labels in the input images. You can use ITK-snap to generate the label images. The optional landmarks weights are read from a text file where each row is either: \"label,labelWeight\" or \"labelWeight\". If the latter format is used, the label weights are assumed to be arranged in ascending order by label."
