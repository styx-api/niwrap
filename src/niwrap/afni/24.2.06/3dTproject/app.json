    "description": "This program projects (detrends) out various 'nuisance' time series from each voxel in the input dataset.  Note that all the projections are done via linear regression, including the frequency-based options such as '-passband'.  In this way, you can bandpass time-censored data, and at the same time, remove other time series of no interest (e.g., physiological estimates, motion parameters)."
