Either of the inputs may have multiple vectors (more than 3 columns), but not both (at least one must have exactly 3 columns).  The -magnitude and -normalize-output options may not be specified together, or with an operation that returns a scalar (dot product).  The <operation> parameter must be one of the following:\n\nDOT\nCROSS\nADD\nSUBTRACT"
