    "description": "Create surface approximating a cortical layer.\n\nThe input surfaces must have vertex correspondence.  The output surface is generated by placing vertices between the two surfaces such that the enclosed volume within any small patch of the new and white surfaces is the given fraction of the volume of the same patch between the pial and white surfaces (i.e., specifying 0 would give the white surface, 1 would give the pial surface)."
