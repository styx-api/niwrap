  "help_text": "The mapping along the specified direction must be parcels, scalars, or labels.  For pscalar or ptseries, use COLUMN to reorder the parcels.  For dlabel, use ROW.  The <reorder-list> file must contain 1-based indices separated by whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs, etc), with as many indices as <cifti-in> has along the specified dimension.  These indices specify which current index should end up in that position, for instance, if the current order is 'A B C D', and the desired order is 'D A B C', the text file should contain '4 1 2 3'.",
