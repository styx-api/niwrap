    "description": "Compare correlation locally and across/through sulci/gyri.\n\nFor each vertex, compute the average correlation within a range of geodesic distances that don't cross a sulcus/gyrus, and the correlation to the closest vertex crossing a sulcus/gyrus.  A vertex is considered to cross a sulcus/gyrus if the 3D distance is less than a third of the geodesic distance.  The output file contains the ratio between these correlations, and some additional maps to help explain the ratio."
