    "description": "Dump cifti matrix into other formats.\n\nThis command is used to convert a full CIFTI matrix to/from formats that can be used by programs that don't understand CIFTI.  You must specify exactly one of -to-gifti-ext, -from-gifti-ext, -to-nifti, -from-nifti, -to-text, or -from-text.\n\nThis command cannot map surface-based parts of the cifti file to a spatially-correct volume file, or map volume-based data to the surface, see -volume-to-surface-mapping and -metric-to-volume-mapping instead (other commands such as -cifti-separate are also required).\n\nIf you want to write an existing CIFTI file with a different CIFTI version, see -file-convert, and its -cifti-version-convert option.\n\nIf you want part of the CIFTI file as a metric, label, or volume file, see -cifti-separate.  If you want to create a CIFTI file from metric and/or volume files, see the -cifti-create-* commands.\n\nIf you want to import a matrix in non-CIFTI format that is restricted to an ROI, first obtain a template CIFTI file matching that ROI (you can use -cifti-create-dense-scalar if you don't have such a file).  Use -cifti-convert to import it to CIFTI format, and you can then expand the file into a standard brainordinates space with -cifti-create-dense-from-template.  If you want to export only part of a CIFTI file, first create an roi-restricted CIFTI file with -cifti-restrict-dense-mapping.\n\nThe -transpose option to -from-gifti-ext is needed if the replacement binary file is in column-major order.\n\nThe -unit options accept these values:\n\nSECOND\nHERTZ\nMETER\nRADIAN"
