This method is not generally recommended for surface resampling, but is provided for completeness.\n\nThe BARYCENTRIC method is generally recommended for anatomical surfaces, in order to minimize smoothing.\n\nFor cut surfaces (including flatmaps), use -surface-cut-resample.\n\nInstead of resampling a spherical surface, the -surface-sphere-project-unproject command is recommended.\n\nThe <method> argument must be one of the following:\n\nADAP_BARY_AREA\nBARYCENTRIC\n",
