    "description": "Map label file to volume.\n\nMaps labels from a gifti label file into a volume file.  You must specify exactly one mapping method option.  The -nearest-vertex method uses the label from the vertex closest to the voxel center.  The -ribbon-constrained method uses the same method as in -volume-to-surface-mapping, then uses the weights in reverse, with popularity logic to decide on a label to use."
