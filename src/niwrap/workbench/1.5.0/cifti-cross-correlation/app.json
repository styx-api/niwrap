The mapping along columns in <cifti-b> becomes the mapping along rows in the output.\n\nWhen using the -fisher-z option, the output is NOT a Z-score, it is artanh(r), to do further math on this output, consider using -cifti-math.\n\nRestricting the memory usage will make it calculate the output in chunks, by reading through <cifti-b> multiple times."
