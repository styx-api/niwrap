  "description": "Flip all tiles on a surface.\n\nFlips all triangles on a surface, resulting in surface normals being flipped the other direction (inward vs outward).  If you transform a surface with an affine that has negative determinant, or a warpfield that similarly flips the surface, you may end up with a surface that has normals pointing inwards, which may have display problems.  Using this command will solve that problem.",
